- The program is trained with itself over 10,000 times and the resulting solutions are saved and updated each time.
- Program saves all the winning and loosing conditions and branches thru turns using binary search algorithm.
- Program's competence is tested using a confidence level. Using this the program can decide what winning strategy to use.
